jpoles1.github.io - Jordan Poles' Personal Website
=================
This repository contains the code which drives my personal website. 
Templating is accomplished using handlebars.js and jquery-based ajax fetching of content. This content is stored in a structured manner within the resume.json datafile. This enables neat and easy updates to be pushed to the website!
